# AI Debate Practice System

## Quick Start & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+**
- **web browser** (Chrome)
- **Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Installation & Running
```bash
# Clone the repository
cd Debate_Bot2_main

# Install dependencies
npm install
OR (If above command doesn't work)
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
OR (If it still doesn't work)
npm install --force

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### API Key Setup
1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Enter the API key in the application when prompted
3. The system will test the connection automatically

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

# Project Overview

## Problem Statement
Traditional debate practice is limited by access to skilled opponents, inconsistent feedback, lack of structured progression, and difficulty tracking improvement. Our system solves these with AI-powered, real-time, skill-adaptive debate simulation and mathematical judging.

## Solution
- **Intelligent AI Opponents**: Context-aware, skill-adaptive debaters
- **Mathematical Judging**: Objective, weighted clash analysis
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: 6-dimensional, actionable insights
- **Real-time Simulation**: Live debate, typing effects, timing
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed history and analytics

---

# Key Features

- **AI-Generated Case Prep**: Strategic arguments, rebuttals, evidence
- **Skill-Based Learning**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
- **Parliamentary Debate Format**: Realistic roles and structure
- **Mathematical Judging**: Weighted clash analysis, bias prevention
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Criteria-based, actionable, transparent
- **Live Simulation**: Typing effects, timing, real-time AI adaptation
- **Progress Tracking**: History, analytics, downloadable transcripts
- **Modern UI/UX**: Responsive, accessible, smooth navigation

# Mathematical Judging Algorithm

- **Clash Identification**: AI finds major argument conflicts
- **Weight Assignment**: Each clash gets an importance score (1-10)
- **Clash Resolution**: Winners determined by logic, evidence
- **Score Calculation**: Σ(ClashWeight × ClashOutcome × CriteriaMultiplier) / TotalPossiblePoints × 100
- **Bias Prevention**: Multiple evaluation passes

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Argument Quality** 
- **Logical Coherence**
- **Rhetorical Techniques**
- **Response to Opposition** 
- **Structure & Time Management**
- **Delivery & Presentation**
