### Voice Service Architecture

The voice functionality is built around a centralized `VoiceService` class that provides:

```typescript
// Core voice service methods
voiceService.startListening(onResult, onError, onStart, onEnd)
voiceService.stopListening()
voiceService.speak(text, onStart, onEnd, onError)
voiceService.stopSpeaking()
```

### Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support for all features
- **Firefox**: Limited support (may require HTTPS)
- **Safari**: Limited support
- **Mobile Browsers**: Varies by platform

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Processing**: Minimal CPU usage during recognition
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of audio resources
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic restart on recognition failures
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient power usage on mobile devices

## Settings and Configuration

### Voice Input Settings

- **Language**: English (US/UK/India)
- **Continuous Recognition**: Enable/disable continuous mode
- **Interim Results**: Show/hide partial transcriptions
- **Max Alternatives**: Number of alternative transcriptions (1-5)

### Voice Output Settings

- **Voice Selection**: Choose from available system voices
- **Speech Rate**: 0.5x to 2.0x speed
- **Pitch**: 0.5x to 2.0x pitch modification
- **Volume**: 0% to 100% volume level

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Speech recognition not supported"**
